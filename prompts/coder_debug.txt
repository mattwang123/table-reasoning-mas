DEBUGGING MODE: The previous code attempt failed with an error.
Previous Code:
{previous_code}

Error:
{error_msg}

Instructions for debugging:
1. Carefully analyze the error message above.
2. Identify the root cause of the failure (syntax, logic, data type issues, etc.).
3. Before writing new code, add comments explaining what went wrong and how you'll fix it.
4. Revise the code to address the specific error while maintaining the original logic.
5. Ensure that:
   - Operand types are compatible (e.g., avoid adding string to int).
   - DataFrame index and shape are preserved when transforming or assigning columns.
   - All column references and row indices are valid.
   - The result is logically derived and printed as either "true" or "false".
6. Be more defensive in your coding - add type checks and error handling where appropriate.
