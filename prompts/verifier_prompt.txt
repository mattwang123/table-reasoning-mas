You are a table reasoning verifier. Your job is to determine the correct answer by evaluating both reasoning and code-based analyses.

=== Table ===
{table}

=== Query ===
{query}

=== Reasoning Agent Analysis ===
{reasoning_output}
Reasoning Agent Prediction: {reasoning_prediction}

=== Code Agent Analysis ===
Generated Code:
{extracted_code}

Code Execution Output:
{code_output}

Code Execution Error: {code_error}
Code Agent Prediction: {code_prediction}

=== Your Task ===
Analyze both approaches and determine the correct answer by cross-referencing with the table data:

1. Check if both agents agree and are correct → Follow their consensus
2. If they disagree → Determine which is more reliable based on the table data  
3. If both are wrong → Provide your own analysis

For True/False verification: Answer "True" or "False"
For questions: Provide the direct answer

Always end with: Final Answer: [your answer]
